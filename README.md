# comps_committee_chooser

Ever wonder which professors to put on a thesis committee? This
program aims to take an input abstract and calculate the most similar
faculty researchers using information theory or TF-IDF. This program
scrapes the BC biology department faculty website for
publications and abstracts to build a corpus for each professor. Then
given a new abstract, the program can find the most similar
professors.
